    "In this lab you will explore one of the most common data formats in public transit: General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). Specifcally, we will be looking at a static GTFS feed from Calgary, Canada to calculate some basic attributes about the system and learn how this data source is structured. By the end of this lab you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read in multiple tables from a provided GTFS source and join them together where necessary.\n",
    "* Convert the \"time\" portions of a GTFS feed into something useful for temporal analysis.\n",
    "* Answer some questions about basic system characteristics based on your calculations.\n",
