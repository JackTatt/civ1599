# CIV1599 - Analytics for Transit and Mobility Systems


Welcome to the GitHub for the code-based content used/developed for the Fall 2022
offering of CIV 1599 - Analytics for Transit and Mobility Systems.

If you find yourself on this page and are not sure what this is - you're probably
in the wrong spot... though you are welcome to take a look at round as this
repository contains labs and worked examples for a first-of-its-kind graduate
course which surveys and examines data analytics specifically for transit and other
sustainable mobility systems.

## Getting Started
To use the workbooks in this course you will need to set up a modern (ideally 3.9+) version of Python on your computer. You will also need to install a relatively wide set of libraries which are useful for the various data analysis sections we walk through.

### Using Conda (Miniconda)
In some of these modules we will be working with spatial and machine learning libraries which can be particularly tricky to get working on Windows computers using the standard Python and `pip` approach to installing. If you are comfortable spending the time getting these to work (I highly suggest looking into `pipwin` in this case), or are using linux and would like to preserve the Python installation you currently have on your computer you can install the libraries yourself as required.

If you are looking for the easy way, we are going to be using the `conda` package manager (Python developers love their snake and Monty Python references), the simplist of which is [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
