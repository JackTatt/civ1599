# CIV1599 - Analytics for Transit and Mobility Systems


Welcome to the GitHub for the code-based content used/developed for the Fall 2022
offering of CIV 1599 - Analytics for Transit and Mobility Systems.

If you find yourself on this page and are not sure what this is - you're probably
in the wrong spot... though you are welcome to take a look at round as this
repository contains labs and worked examples for a first-of-its-kind graduate
course which surveys and examines data analytics specifically for transit and other
sustainable mobility systems.
